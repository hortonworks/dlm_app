# dlm-web

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Installing NPM packages
If you don't have `yarn` package manager already, install it via `npm -g install yarn`

Use `yarn install` to install NPM packages.

When changing package versions, use `yarn upgrade` command (e.g., `yarn upgrade mypackage@1.2.0`.
This updates the package as well as `package.json` and `yarn.lock`.
Both files should be included in your commit if modified.
